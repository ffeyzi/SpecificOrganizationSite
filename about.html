				<h2>Activities and Events</h2>
				<h3>Philanthropy</h3>
				<p>As part of the plan to be better men for a better world, the Upsilon Omega chapter strives to host and attend many philanthropy events. Recently, the chapter had an event in which they partnered up with Camp Kesem and wrote letters to raise money for children whose families have been affected by cancer. The Upsilon Omega Chapter also work with other organizations including St. Jude's Childrens Hospital, Stand Up for Kids Homeless Shelter, and the Second Harvest Food Bank.</p>
				<h3>Mixers</h3>
				<p>Mixers happen very often throughout every quarter. These events are a great chance for members of the fraternity to socialize and get to know some members of every sorority. </p>
				<h3>Brotherhood Events</h3>
				<p>Brotherhood is the bond that keeps the fraternity; therefore, a couple times a quarter we hold events that include going hiking, camping, to a sports game, golfing, or trips together.</p>
				<h3>Red Carnation Ball</h3>
				<p>Red Carnation Ball is our formal event that happens towards the end of every spring quarter. This weekend long formal event is a fun time where everyone attends and some of the best college memories are made.</p>
				<h3>Conferences</h3>
				<p>We make a commitment to attending the regional leadership conferences and conclaves that Tau Kappa Epsilon holds. It is a great chance to network with fraters from other chapters and learn some new things.</p>
				<h3>Sports</h3>
				<p>Our brothers make a commitment to create many teams in many different sports in the school-wide intramural league.</p>
