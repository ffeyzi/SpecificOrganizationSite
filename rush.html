			<h2>What We Are All About</h2>
			<h3>Scholarship</h3>
			<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon expects serious attention to academic performance. A strong academic record not only prepares members for success after graduation, but it also helps them strengthen their mind to the world. TKE will help its members excel in their academic life and assist in their pursuits afterward.</p>
			<h3>Character</h3>
			<p>TKE teaches the basic principles of effective living such as integrity, honesty and patience, which are core values in Tau Kappa Epsilon. Generations of men have become successful in life through their experiences in Tau Kappa Epsilon.</p>
			<h3>Leadership</h3>
			<p>TKE offers your men the opportunity to develop as leaders and prepares them to use those leadership skills during their lifetime. Tekes are encouraged to take an active leadership role in community, campus, and chapter activities.</p>
			<h3>Teamwork</h3>
			<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon believes that the backbone of a successful team is based on building relationships, and developing strong interpersonal ties. TKE helps our members reach their full potential, and achieve a level of excellence in every activity in which they engage.</p>
			<h3>Service</h3>
			<p>TKE is committed to instilling a sense of responsibility and contribution in all of our members. The Fraternity encourages members to provide service to their campus and community through philanthropic activities.</p>
			<h3>Brotherhood</h3>
			<p>In Tau Kappa Epsilon hundreds of thousands of men have established solid friendships that last a lifetime. Tekes around the world act as a network of friends, which can be very beneficial both personally and professionally to our members.</p>
			<h3>Social</h3>
			<p>The TKE social calendar will provide you with more than enough opportunities to have a good time.</p>
			<h2>Rush Process</h2>
			<p>The Upsilon Omega chapter has rush once a year, during winter quarter. Keep an eye out on Facebook for the official event. There will be a large rush barbeque with all the other fraternities on the first day, and then rush will continue through the rest of the week. We hope to see you out there rushing TKE.</p>
